   Brighton Football Club's journey from the verge of liquidation to European football is a story that has stolen the hearts of football fans worldwide. Many would pin this down to the integration of data within the clubs scouting set up. This project dives deep into the club's resurgence, tracing its path from financial adversity to Premier League success. It explores how Brighton use xG, presses and progressive carries as data metrics to identify and nurture talent which they can make a profit from as well as use for themselves. The project also dives into success stories, looking into Brighton's exemplary business in the transfer market and how the club takes the approach of merging data with traditional scouting.

   Brighton Football Club's journey from dire financial straits to European football prominence can be seen as a result of data driven scouting. (Givenchy, 2023) From being on the brink of bankruptcy, the club has become a formidable force in the Premier League. This article explores how Brighton were able to recover from the edge of bankruptcy, how they use data to scout players and examples of success they had.

   Relegated from top flight football in 1983, a quick descent led to them being on the verge of liquidation in 1997. Following years of financial management, the club was left homeless as the board had to sell its stadium, Goldstone Ground, to pay its debts. They were once 13 points from the bottom of Division Three. They would soon be taken over by Dick Knight, a local fan and businessman who led a consortium that bought the club for £100. He oversaw growth as the club achieved back-to-back promotions before the club saw a takeover by another local businessman, Tony Bloom. Bloom oversaw the construction of a new home in the American Express Community Stadium, a turning point for a club that were nomadic for the 14 years prior. Within 6 years, he fired Brighton from League 1 into the Premier League, forging one of the greatest stories in English football. (Chambers, 2023)

   Brighton play an attacking brand of football with xG, pressures and progressive carries being three of the most important data metrics for this style of football. Bauer and Anzer developed xG to objectively quantify the quality of any given shot. (Bauer et al, 2021) England Football defines pressures as when pressure is applied on the player or the team in possession. (The Football Association, 2022) I will refer to pressures as presses. Stats Perform defines progressive carries as carries in the opposition half which moves the balls at least 5 meters towards the opposition goal. (McKeever, no date) Brighton like to play as high as they can in the opposition half, with their defenders usually at the halfway line. Figure 1 provides a visual.
   <br>
   <img src="Figure 1.png" alt="Figure 1 - shows position of Brighton Players in Attack - defenders on the halfway line ">
   <h6>Figure 1 - shows position of Brighton Players in Attack - defenders on the halfway line</h6>
   <br>
   Progressive carries are important as it would allow the team to go higher and higher up the pitch, which is what they aim for with a possession-based style focused on controlling the ball. This is key when identifying midfielders, as it would show who exceeds at bringing the ball high up the pitch and giving it to the forwards. As of writing, Brighton currently sit 6th for xG in the Premier League as Figure 2 shows, behind the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City. (FBRef, 2023) 
   <br>
   <img src="yhyh.png" alt="Figure 2 - shows Brighton's performance on xG as a table compared with other clubs">
   <h6>Figure 2 - shows Brighton's performance on xG as a table compared with other clubs</h6>
   <br>
   When identifying attackers, a high xG would indicate an attacker can get into threatening positions to score. Brighton have a high xG, indicating their strikers get into menacing spaces, which would explain why they sit in a European qualifying position as of writing whilst averaging 2 goals a game. (Garratt-Stanley, 2022) Brighton like to apply pressure constantly throughout a match. How much a player presses indicates their work rate and intensity, key to a successful press. (Sialis, 2023) Identifying key metrics such as these and finding players for them allows Brighton to keep striking gold in the transfer market, which has allowed for seamless transitions between managers and has seen them progress into European competition. This is done alongside developing and selling players for high prices and profits, which the next section will cover.

   As far as the transfer market is concerned, Brighton has the lowest net spend in the Premier League since the 21/22 summer window. This shows as far as money is concerned, Brighton conducts the best business in the transfer market, so much so they have netted more than 2x than the next best club. (Squawka, 2023) Figure 3 shows the net spend of all Premier League teams since the 21/22 summer window.

   <h6>Figure 3 - Shows the net spend of every Premier League team in the 22/23 season since the 21/22 summer window</h6>
   <br>
   <center><h4><u>Moises Caicedo</u></h4></center>
   <br>
   Brighton bought Moises Caicedo for £4 million a little under 3 years ago and 6 months ago, they sold him for a British record transfer fee for £115 million. (Transfermarkt, 2023) His DataMB profile as of writing is shown in Figure 4 below
   <br>
   <img src="Caicedo.png" alt="Figure 4 - Shows Caicedo's percentile on each statistic at the top and a visual layout below">
   <h6>Figure 4 - Shows Caicedo's percentile on each statistic at the top and a visual layout below</h6>
   <br>
   Whilst his carrying isn’t impressive, he operates as a deeper midfielder. This usually involves winning the ball back and making a forward pass to midfielders who are higher up. He is in the 95th percentile for duels won and he is in the 93rd percentile of his forward passes, world class rankings. He was bought from Ecuador and sold for over £110 million profit. (Naylor, 2023)
   <br>
   <center><h4><u>Alexis Mac Allister</u></h4></center>
   <br>
   According to Transfermarkt, Brighton bought Alexis Mac Allister for €8.00 million in January 2019 and sold him for €65.00 million in July 2023. (Transfermarkt, 2023) They sold him for more than 8 times the investment in him within the short space of 4 and a half years. Mac Allister doesn’t seem like an elite player on any specific data metrics, with his DataMB profile in Figure 5 being mediocre or below mediocre in all metrics. (DataMB, 2023)
   <br>
   <img src="MacAllister.png" alt="Figure 5 - Shows Mac Allisters percentile on each statistic at the top and a visual layout below">
   <h6>Figure 5 - Shows Mac Allisters percentile on each statistic at the top and a visual layout below</h6>
   <br>
   However, this highlights how Brighton have used the data model in collaboration with traditional methods. Mac Allister has been described as a versatile player who can play in all positions in the midfield by The Athletic. He has also been described as someone with high intelligence and is able to retain the ball well by The Athletic, traits which are hard to measure with data. (Jones, 2023) This shows how well Brighton have implemented data in football, using it alongside traditional scouting methods to find players from obscure parts of the world and turning them into stars.

   <body>
   <center>   
   Brighton Football Club's journey from near bankruptcy to European football shows how data can transform a football club. Their commitment to identifying key metrics and the right players for their vision has not only asserted them as a force in the Premier League but has also allowed them to make substantial profits in the transfer market, one of two clubs to do so in the Premier League since the 21/22 summer window. Brighton's innovative blend of data analysis and traditional scouting has paved the way for data in the world of football.
